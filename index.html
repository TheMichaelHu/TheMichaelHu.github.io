			<h1>Welcome to my domain, literally</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Michael Hu and I'm a second year Computer Science major at Northeastern University. I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with my life, so right now the plan is to just do a lot of really <a href="projects">awesome things</a> until something clicks.</p>
			<p>When not working on software, I tend to dabble in graphic design, video production, photography, tabletop gaming, ultimate frisbee, and adventuring into the wilderness.</p>
			<a href="about"><i>More about me...</i></a>
			
			<h1>What am I doing now?</h1>
			<p>Got my CompTIA A+ ceritification. Bracing myself for fall classes. Going to make an Android app because I'm too lazy to keep track of my spending on an excel doc. Coops are going to be a thing soon, oh god...</p>

			<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
			<p><i>Why computer science?</i></p>
			<p>My first experience programming was with GUIs in elementary school when I did FIRST Lego League and it just sort of stuck. Freshman year of high school I learned C++ for my robotics team and later started making handy little application here and there. I also sort of have a god-complex, but I'm not sure if that's why I like comp sci or simply a consequence of programming since I was a kid.</p>
			<p><i>What languages/frameworks have you used?</i></p>
			<p>I've taken college courses on Racket(a lisp-based language) and Java. For work, I've worked with python in order to write Django applications and javascript so that I could work with a company's js library. I've also used C++ for robotics in highschool and HTML/CSS for my robotics team's website and my own personal one.</p>
			<p><i>What area(s) of computer science do you want to focus on?</i></p>
			<p>No ideas yet but I've always wanted to do something on the cutting edge of technology. Topics like Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality have always interested me because I'm a gamer at heart but I'm a long ways away from working with any of that kind of stuff. A man can dream though...</p>
			<p><i>What experience do you currently have?</i></p>
			<p>Most of the things I've done so far have been web-related because that's the easiest thing I can do on my own right now. Check out my <a href="work">work</a> or <a href="projects">projects</a> pages for specifics or grab a copy on my resume down below.</p>
