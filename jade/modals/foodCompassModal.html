Pointr is a compass-like navigation application for Android wearables. Using Yelp Search API, Pointr locates several nearby eateries in the user’s vicinity and delegates arrows that each point to a vendor’s location. The restaurant that is most directly in front of the customer has information about its distance, Yelp rating, and reviews displayed.</p><p>Users are given the ability to focus on a specfic location that piques their interest, locking the focused location as the set destination.</p><p>Pointr aims not only to save people from dire situations, but to also encourage users to seek out new dining experiences. By offering users multiple easily accessible dining options, and plenty of informative Yelp reviews, users will find themselves trying out new places to eat more often while using this app on the go.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="btn btn-default">Close</button></div></div></div></div>
