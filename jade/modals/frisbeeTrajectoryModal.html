During the 2013 season, robots were 
tasked with launching frisbees through rectangular goals lined with retro-reflective fabric. Using data 
from the robot and <a href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~womens-ult/frisbee_physics.pdf" target="_blank"> 
an MIT paper on frisbee physics</a>, I wrote a java app to predict the trajectory of a frisbee launched from our robot.</p><center><img src="img/diskSim.jpg"/></center><p>Also, using API from a program called <a href="http://www.roborealm.com/" target="_blank"> 
RoboRealm</a> we were able to get the measurements of a target goal as seen from the camera mounted on the robot. 
Using known constants such as the height and angle of the camera, the camera's field of view, robot's 
location, and field measurements in conjunction with the data from RoboRealm, we were able to get the 
camera's distance from the target goal with an error of a few inches.</p><center><img src="img/diskSim2.jpg"/></center><p>Knowing the distance from the goal and the launcher's angle provided suffcient information to calculate 
the necessary velocity for a frisbee to be scored.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="btn btn-default">Close</button></div></div></div></div>
