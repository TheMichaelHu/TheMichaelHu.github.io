I worked on its developement along with four 
other Northeastern students at <a href="http://hackbeanpot.com/" target="_blank"> 
HackBeanpot</a> 2014. The app was built using Node.js and uses Youtube and SoundCloud API to produce results for the 
string the client searches for. Using the <a href="http://playlstr.herokuapp.com/user" target="_blank"> 
user page</a>, clients can queue up songs for the playlist which can then be listened to on the <a href="http://playlstr.herokuapp.com/listener" target="_blank"> 
listener page</a>. Searching a string will produce two lists for the client to choose from: most viewed Youtube videos 
from that search and most popular SoundCloud songs.</p><center><img src="img/playlstr.jpg"/></center><p>This app is only meant to support one listener at a time, although in theory it's possible to have multiple 
listeners without cross-contamination. This app also works as a song sharing site, clients would queue up 
songs they want to share with strangers on the user page and then listen to a random song from somebody 
else on the listener page.</p><p>My role in the team consisted of helping design the app, researching how each API would be integrated, 
and designing the website's background image so that it would have the same theme as Disney's Frozen
(because why not).</p><p>The source code for Playlstr can be found <a href="https://github.com/tomxhu/playlistmaker" target="_blank"> 
here</a>.</p><p><i>Edit: As of April 20, 2015, Youtube API v2 has been retired. Because Youtube API v3 does not support 
anonymous queries, Playlistr's Youtube search features no longer work. I'll be attempting to integrate 
the new API as a later project.</i></p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" data-dismiss="modal" class="btn btn-default">Close</button></div></div></div></div>
